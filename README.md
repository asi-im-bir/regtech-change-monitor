üö® RegTech Change Monitor (Multi-Target PoC)üéØ Project Status and Value PropositionThis is a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating automated, audit-ready Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) monitoring. We transition critical regulatory oversight (e.g., NIS2, AI Act, ISO 27001) from a manual process to a reliable, version-controlled system.The tool directly supports Continuous Risk Assessment and Control Gap Analysis by:Automating Intelligence: Eliminates manual, daily checking of multiple regulatory body websites.Creating an Audit Trail: Logs every check and change to version-controlled files on Git.Enforcing Change Control: Triggers a clear alert when a policy baseline shifts, requiring mandatory human GRC approval.üíª Technical Architecture OverviewThe system operates using a Human-in-the-Loop model. The automation handles detection (low value, high frequency), and the GRC analyst handles risk assessment (high value, low frequency).ComponentFile/SystemFunction / OutcomeInput Scopeconfig/monitor_targets.jsonDefines the Scope: Central list of all monitored URLs and their unique CSS selectors.The Enginemonitor.pyExecutes: Runs the check loop, fetching data and performing string comparison.Audit Artifactsconfig/*_baseline.txt & status_log.jsonStores Truth: Holds the last approved policy text and the history of successful checks.AutomationGitHub Actions / Task SchedulerSchedules: Guarantees daily execution of the script (cron).üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Deployment Guide)RequirementsPython 3.8+The required libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, python-dotenv, and json (installed via requirements.txt).Setup StepsClone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your Repository URL]
cd regtech-change-monitor
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Targets (config/monitor_targets.json):Open this JSON file and define the full list of regulations you need to monitor.CRITICAL: Ensure the selector_id is verified using F12 DevTools for each target_url.Configure Environment (.env):Create a local copy: cp config/.env.example .envSet the top-level REGULATION_NAME for general log identification (e.g., "Company GRC Regulatory Watch").üöÄ Usage, Validation, and GRC Workflow1. Initial Run (Baseline Establishment)The first run connects to all sites and creates the initial reference files.Bashpython monitor.py
Verification: Check the config/ folder. It should contain multiple unique *_baseline.txt files and status_log.json with entries marked "status": "INITIAL_BASELINE".2. Automated Run and Change ControlThis is the fully automated GRC workflow after initial setup.EventAction by AutomationGRC Analyst Action RequiredDaily CheckScript runs, logs status: OK for stable targets, and automatically commits status_log.json to Git.No action. System is confirmed stable.Alert/ChangeScript prints the üö® CHANGE DETECTED alert and creates *_new_content.txt.IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Analyst compares *_new_content.txt against the old baseline in Git history, performs Risk Assessment, and then manually commits the new baseline text to approve the change.3. Production Scheduling (Automation)The system must run daily.SystemCommand/SetupNotesGitHub ActionsSet up the regtech_monitor.yml workflow to run on a cron: '0 8 * * *' schedule.Preferred Method: Ensures auditable, remote execution.Windows Task SchedulerSet up a Daily Task to run the Python executable with the full script path as an argument.Suitable for local machine execution.
