üö® RegTech Change Monitor (Multi-Target PoC)Project Status and ValueThis is a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating automated, audit-ready Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) monitoring. It transitions critical regulatory oversight (e.g., NIS2, AI Act, ISO 27001) from manual effort to a reliable, version-controlled process.The tool directly supports continuous Risk Assessment and Control Gap Analysis by:Automating Intelligence: Eliminates manual checking of multiple regulatory body websites.Creating an Audit Trail: Logs every check and change to JSON files committed to Git.Enforcing Change Control: Triggers an alert when a baseline shifts, requiring human GRC approval.Technical Architecture OverviewThe system operates using a Human-in-the-Loop model. The Python script handles the tedious work; the GRC analyst handles the final, critical sign-off.ComponentFile/SystemFunctionConfigurationconfig/monitor_targets.jsonDefines the Scope: Centralizes all monitored URLs and their unique selectors.The Enginemonitor.pyExecutes: Runs a loop, fetches live data, compares it against the audit baseline.Audit Filesconfig/*_baseline.txt & status_log.jsonStores Truth: Holds the last approved policy text and the history of successful checks.AutomationGitHub Actions / Task SchedulerSchedules: Guarantees the check runs daily (cron).üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Deployment Guide)RequirementsPython 3.8+The requests, beautifulsoup4, python-dotenv, and json libraries (installed via requirements.txt).Setup StepsClone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your Repository URL]
cd regtech-change-monitor
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Targets (config/monitor_targets.json):Open this JSON file and define the full list of regulations you need to monitor.For each entry, ensure the selector_id is correct (e.g., #main-content, .article-body-wrapper). Use F12 DevTools to verify this.Configure Environment (.env):Create a local copy: cp config/.env.example .envSet the top-level REGULATION_NAME for general logging (e.g., "Company GRC Regulatory Watch").üöÄ Usage and Validation1. Initial Run (Baseline Establishment)The first run creates all necessary files.Bashpython monitor.py
Verification: Check the config/ folder. It should now contain:Multiple unique *_baseline.txt files (one for each regulation in the JSON).One status_log.json file containing multiple entries, all marked "status": "INITIAL_BASELINE".2. Automated Run and Change ControlYour project is ready for daily automation. The primary GRC action is performed via the Git audit trail:EventAction by AutomationGRC Analyst Action RequiredDaily CheckScript runs, logs status: OK for stable targets, and automatically commits status_log.json to Git.No action. System is confirmed stable.Alert/ChangeScript prints the üö® CHANGE DETECTED alert and creates *_new_content.txt.IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Analyst compares *_new_content.txt against the old baseline in Git history, performs Risk Assessment, and then manually commits the new baseline text to approve the change.3. Production Scheduling (Automation)To ensure the script runs daily:SystemCommand/SetupNotesGitHub ActionsSet up the regtech_monitor.yml workflow to run on a cron: '0 8 * * *' schedule.This is the preferred method for auditability and remote execution.Windows (Task Scheduler)Set up a Daily Task to run the Python executable with the full path to monitor.py as the argument.This is suitable for local machine execution.
